Their experience with AWS services (EC2, RDS) is also a significant advantage. While the candidate's skill set doesn't explicitly mention Kafka/RabbitMQ or Kubernetes, the presence of related skills like Celery (message queue), Microservices, and Docker suggests a potential for quick adaptation. The absence of explicit mention of security best practices and high-throughput systems should be reviewed.",
