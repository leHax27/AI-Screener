================================================================================

We're looking for a Junior Backend Developer to join our small but growing

career who wants to learn from experienced engineers. You'll start with 
simpler tasks and gradually take on more complex projects as you grow.

------------------------------------
- Personal projects or college projects using Python

================================================================================
                         WHAT YOU'LL LEARN
================================================================================

In your first 6 months, you'll learn:
- Django and Django REST Framework

- Git workflows and code review process
- Deployment basics (we use Heroku/AWS)
- Agile development practices

                         WHAT WE OFFER
================================================================================

- Salary: ₹4-8 LPA (based on skills)
- Fully remote work
- Flexible hours (just overlap with team for meetings)
- Learning stipend (₹20,000/year for courses, books)

                         HOW TO APPLY
================================================================================

Send us:
1. Your resume
2. Link to any projects (GitHub, deployed apps, anything!)
